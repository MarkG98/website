I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) Joint Program within the EECS department at MIT and the AOP&E department at WHOI. My research is focused on using machine learning to augment the abilities of acoustic sensors for large-scale ocean monitoring. 

I am affiliated with the Ocean Acoustics and Signals Lab (OASL) and the <a href="https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/dzitterbart" target="_blank">Marine Animal Remote Sensing Lab (MARS)</a> at WHOI and am co-advised by Drs. Julien Bonnel and Daniel Zitterbart.
